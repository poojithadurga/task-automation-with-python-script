# task-automation-with-python-script
This Python script is designed to help you organize your image files by automatically moving them from one folder to another. Whether you're dealing with a cluttered computer, trying to consolidate photos from multiple sources, or simply want to keep your files tidy, this script can be a huge time-saver. When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the path of the folder where your images are currently stored (the source folder) and the path of the folder where you want to move them (the destination folder). The script will then scan the source folder for any files with `.jpg` or `.png` extensions, which are common file types for images. If the destination folder doesn't exist, the script will create it for you, so you don't have to worry about setting it up beforehand. As the script moves your images, it will also check for any duplicate file names in the destination folder. If it finds a duplicate, it will rename the new file by adding "_copy" to the end of the filename, ensuring that you don't lose any files or overwrite existing ones. Once the script has finished moving your images, it will display a message telling you how many files were moved. Overall, this script is a simple yet powerful tool that can help you get your image files organized and make it easier to find what you need.
